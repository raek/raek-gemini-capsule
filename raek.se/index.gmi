# raek's capsule

Welcome to my capsule, fellow geminaut! This capsule was launched 2022-07-17.

Everything on this capsule (raek.se) is Gemini exclusive. Stuff that are also available via HTTPS are served on other subdomains (for example, blog.raek.se).

## My Stuff

=> gemlog/ Gemlog - Gemini exclusive!
Here I write shorter texts. More personal. Less sensical.

=> gemini://blog.raek.se/ Blog - also on HTTPs
My blog is served on both Gemini and HTTPS. Most of the posts were written before I launched my Gemini capsule, but have been converted to gemtext for comfortable reading.

=> links/recommendations.gmi Recommended Capsules and Pages
Gemini space is an interesting place! This is where I keep links to things you should check out.

=> projects/retrograde/ Retrograde
A Python library for hosting orbits ("webrings").

=> books.gmi Books I've read
Chronological list starting from 2019 (when I had a reading resurgence).

=> test.gmi Gemini client test page
Unicode and emojis in domain names! I set up some silly domains so you don't have to.

=> https://raek.se/ My old-fashioned HTTP website
Since you're visiting from Gemini, you might not be scared by the unformatted HTML.

Yeah, I have one too.

## Orbits

An orbit is a ring of Gemini pages linking to each other (like a webring on the web, but for Gemini).

### Omloppsbanan

An orbit of capsules by Swedish geminauts.

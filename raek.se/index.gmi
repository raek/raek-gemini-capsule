Welcome to my capsule, fellow geminaut! This capsule was launched 2022-07-17.

## My Stuff

=> gemini://blog.raek.se/ Gemlog
This is a gemini version of my blog. Most of the posts were written before I launched my gemini capsule, but have been converted to gemtext for comfortable reading.

=> links/recommendations.gmi Recommended Capsules and Pages
Gemini space is an interesting place! This is where I keep links to things you should check out.

=> books.gmi Books I've read
Chronological list starting from 2019 (when I had a reading resurgence).

=> test.gmi Gemini client test page
Unicode and emojis in domain names! I set up some silly domains so you don't have to.

=> https://raek.se/ My old-fashioned HTTP website
Since you're visiting from gemini, you might not be scared by the unformatted HTML.

## Low Earth Orbit (LEO)

An orbit is a circular linked list of gemini capsules (like a webring on the web, but for gemini). LEO is the only orbit I know so far. Please tell me if you find any more!

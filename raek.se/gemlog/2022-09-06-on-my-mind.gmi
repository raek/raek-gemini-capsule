# On my mind

I've seen some other people make lists of what they are into right now. Great idea! This is what has been on my mind lately, in no particular order:

* Time and astronomy - how calendars relate to what the sun and the moon looks like from earth.
* Protobuf - a library by Google for (de)serializing structured data into streams of bytes. The "varint" idea looks the same as "VLQ" in MIDI.
* Music - the choire at my church recently started rehearsing again after the summer break. Bass clef. New songs. Fun!
* Todo lists and taking notes - listened to the Swedish podcast Kodsnack ("code chat", not "cod snack") about todo lists, Zettelkasten and all those kind of things.
* Quantum Mechanics - I started reading David Tong's excellent lecture notes. I've read his lecture notes about particle physics before.
* TikZ - A graphics lagnuage for (La)TeX. VERY powerful. I barely scratched the surface and I know that this language "fits my brain". You write code that turn into pretty diagrams.

That's it for now. Thanks for reading!

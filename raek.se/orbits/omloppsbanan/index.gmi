An orbit is a collection of capsules linking to each other in a ring. This is an orbit for capsules authored by Swedish geminauts. The capsule itself does not have to be in Swedish or relate to Sweden at all.

=> random Jump to a random page in the orbit

## How to join Omloppsbanan

For a page to be a member of the orbit it needs to be of MIME type text/gemtext and contain links to these pages:

```
Required:
=> gemini://raek.se/orbits/omloppsbanan/ About Omloppsbanan
=> gemini://raek.se/orbits/omloppsbanan/next?<YOUR URL> Next Page
=> gemini://raek.se/orbits/omloppsbanan/prev?<YOUR URL> Previous Page

Optional:
=> gemini://raek.se/orbits/omloppsbanan/random?<YOUR URL> Random Page
```

The link texts ("Next Page" etc) are merely suggestions and do not need to match these examples. The links can appear anywhere on the page.

=> genlinks Generate the above links automatically for your page URL

With the links in place on you page, simply follow one of the next/previous/random links and Omloppsbanan will discover your page and include it in the orbit.

## Dead Links

The pages in the orbit will be checked from time to time and dead URLs will be pruned from the ring. If you find a dead page you can also trigger an page check manuallt. The page will then be checked in a couple of minutes.

=> check Trigger page check

A page can be added back to the ring by issuing a page check for its URL when it is up again.

# I Guested The European Ham Radio Show

The European Ham Radio Show is a weekly YouTube live-show about everything amateur radio. I discovered it late 2023 (when they were guests at the Ham Radio Workbench podcast) and quickly found my way into the friendly community on their Discord server. The Discord is a great active place where people share their adventures in portable operation, DIY projects, and so much more.

I was very happy (and a bit starstruck) when they invited me into the show to talk about my DIY projects! The show went great, despite me being a bit nervous at first. I had a really fun time hanging out with them and in the end the hour just swooshed by. I admire the amount of work they put into sharing their hobby – it certainly has inspired me to try many new things – and I relish that I was given the opportunity to join one of their shows.

Have a watch if you want to!
